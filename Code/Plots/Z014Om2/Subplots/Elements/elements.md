# Hydrogen

Hydrogen decreases the most where mass loss is the highest

# Helium

Same as hydrogen

# Carbon

Same as carbon

# Nitrogen

Nitrogen is more on the surface of stars with the lower mass loss. They rotate faster.
Above 40 solar mass this changes. More nitrogen on the surface of slow rotating stars of 50 and 60 M.
This is due to a higher mass loss. Inner layers become visible as surface.
