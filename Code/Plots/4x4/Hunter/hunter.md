# NH + 12

This is log (nitrogen / 14 * hydrogen) + 12 and this is observable. 
The star that spins down the fastest is left in the diagram. 
The star that spins down the fastest has less nitrogen to push to the surface. 
There is a threshold mass were surface nitrogen is more dependend on mass loss then on rotational mixing: because the surface is blown away in the winds, deeper layers in the star become visible with diferent elements. This limit seems to be between 40 and 50?
The colorbar is log(g) instead of age. This is because g decreases over time and is therefore also a marker for age. Nice thing: g is observable. 

# Nitrogen

This is a mass fraction of the whole star. You see that the stars with the most mass loss rotate slower and have less nitrogen at their surface.
