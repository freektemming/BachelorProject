The stars all lose mass so the total mass fraction starts at 1 and decreases to a lower value. 
The core mass is plotted around 0.5, depending on the initial mass. 
Heavier stars have a higher relative core mass. They burn their hydrogen quicker. 
Stars with more mass loss due to a different model, also have lower core masses (look into this: relative to what?)
